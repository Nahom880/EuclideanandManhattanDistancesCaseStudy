# Euclidean and Manhattan Distances Case Study

Euclidean and Manhattan Distance Calculations
In this short mini-project, you will see examples and comparisons of distance measures. Specifically, you'll visually compare the Euclidean distance to the Manhattan distance measures. The application of distance measures has many uses in data science and is the foundation of many algorithms you'll be using such as Principal Components Analysis.
